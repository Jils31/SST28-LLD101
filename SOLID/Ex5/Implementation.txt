According to Readme.md file it is clearly mentioned that this code is violating the LSP principle, and how it is violating
is the parent which is the Exporter class, always expects an export result from it's child classes.

Thus we have to change the Child exporters by defining a contract or rules which we can say and we have to apply those rules
to each and every child classes.

Defined all the precondition and postcondition in the base class which is Exporter.
They are like the request must not be null, the title or body can be null (this is the assumption) and the postconditions are
result must always be returned in the form of ExportResult, no child class should throw this exceptions, and also the data should
be meaningful.

Now the changes that have been done in this structure:
1. Exporter: this is the base class so defined some rules that should be followed and also removed the null handling from one of 
it's child class which is JsonExporter and defined that in this base class, thus the req are handled at the base level.

2. ExportResult: error and a boolean success is added in this class, so to maintain the condition of the length and all the things,
rather than throwing exception just use this new ExportResult(error) constructor that we defined in this class.

3. PdfExporter: rather than throwing the exception we will now return the new ExportResult(error), thus the condition of LSP
is satisfied as the base class is getting the ExportResult only.

4. CsvExporter: instead of removing the characters, we have handled them correctly, using the escape method.
5. JsonExporter: rather then crashing when the req is null, we have moved this to the null check to the base level,
thus this class is only responsible for the exporting in JSON format.
